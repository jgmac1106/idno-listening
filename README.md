Watching for Known
==================

Trying to fork Watching for Known. Adds support for publishing what you're listenin to the [Known
CMS](http://withknown.com). To install, simply clone this repository to your
`IdnoPlugins` subdirectory of your Known installation, using the directory name
`Listening`, and enable the plugin.

This plugin currently does not work. Not recommended for use.
